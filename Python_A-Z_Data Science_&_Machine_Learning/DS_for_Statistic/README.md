# **Sample Theory :**


"researchpy" gives us more meaningful result

import researchpy as rp

**Bernoulli : we have to decide unter uncertanity  "0"-"1" categorical** 


${\displaystyle f(k;p)=p^{k}(1-p)^{1-k}\quad {\text{for }}k\in \{0,1\}}$


${\displaystyle \operatorname {E} \left(X\right)=p}$

$\operatorname {Var} [X]=pq=p(1-p)$


Our aim is to find something specific about uncertainty..


**Poission : calculate a probability of rare events in a specific area and time**

An event is accepted with 'n>50' and 'n.p<5' 

-  should have 2 outcomes
-  must take under the same conditions
-  should be independent 


**Normal Distribution:** 

${\displaystyle f(x\mid \mu ,\sigma ^{2})={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2\pi \sigma ^{2}}}}e^{-{\frac {(x-\mu )^{2}}{2\sigma ^{2}}}}}$

$\mu$ : mean


**Hypothesis :** a scientific technique. has two types;
- H0(zero hypothesis) : $\mu$  = 50
- H1(alternative hypothesis) : $\mu$ =/ 50
