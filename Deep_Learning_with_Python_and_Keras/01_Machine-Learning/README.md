*Supervised Learning:* an algorithm learns from abeled data.

*Unsupervised Learning:* data comes without label, the task is to find similar data points in the dataset.

*Reinforcement Learning:* is similar to supervised learning, but in this case, the algorithm is training an agent to act in an environment.
