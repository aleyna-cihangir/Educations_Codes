## Intro to Deep Learning

*What is Neural Network?*

We have as the input to the neural network the size of a house which one we call x. It goes into this node, this little circle and then it outputs the price which we call y. So this little circle called a single neuron in a neural network.

- ReLU : This function which goes to zero sometimes and then it'll takes of as a straight line. This function is called a ReLU function which stands for rectified linear units. So R-E-L-U. And rectify just means taking a max of 0 which is why you get a function shape like this.

- Supervised Learning : you have some input x, and you want to learn a function mapping to some output y. What should be x and what should be y for your particular problem, and then fitting this supervised learning component into a system.

For image applications we'll often use convolution neural networks

**Supervised Learning with Neural Networks**

In supervised learning, you have some input x, and you want to learn a function mapping to some output y.
